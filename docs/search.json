    "text": "Front Matter\nThe content in this “book”, as the title suggests, is related to data visualization. The content and material in this book will help you to be able to think critically about the how visual summaries of data are created and their role in the data narrative for facilitating people’s understanding about patterns and relationships in data. It will also cover the use of computational tools and methods for creating visualizations via R, a statistical computing environment. Lastly, the book also helps you think about how data visualization is a method of communication—it is one way that people communicate with data—and how we can make use of several principles for communicating in a more effective manner.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The first set of tools we will discuss will be related to reproducibility. Reproducibility, the idea that same results from a study should be obtained if the study is repeated, is a key part of the scientific process. Here, we are particularly concerned with statistical reproducibility. That is, given the same data and same code, two analysts should get the exact same results.\nIn practice, reproducibility means making your data and syntax available to other researchers. There are many ways to do this, but the Open Science Framework website is a fantastic option for making resources from research projects openly accessible to other researchers. Aside from the obvious advantages of minimizing fraud and bias, making research artifacts openly available also improves trust in the scientific process.\n\nPROTIP\nMaking your data and syntax available is something to consider during the planning phases of a study so that you can make this transparent in the IRB proposal.\n\nThe initial chapters of this book will address:\n\nInstalling Quarto and other computational tools;\nProject organization; and\nUsing Quarto to integrate text and computation.",
