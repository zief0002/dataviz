The content in this "book", as the title suggests, is related to data visualization. The content and material in this book will help you to be able to think critically about the how visual summaries of data are created and their role in the data narrative for facilitating people's understanding about patterns and relationships in data. It will also cover the use of computational tools and methods for creating visualizations via R, a statistical computing environment. Lastly, the book also helps you think about how data visualization is a method of communication---it is one way that people communicate with data---and how we can make use of several principles for communicating in a more effective manner. 


<!-- While it is a book intended for applied practitioners in the educational or social sciences, and the statistical content is hopefully presented in a manner that these domain scientists will find useful, it does require a good [foundation in regression analysis using the GLM](https://zief0002.github.io/modeling/). Moreover, since the content is somewhat mathematical in nature, the reader will need a solid understanding of algebra for maximum benefit. The burden of calculation that typically accompanied statistical work in previous generations is now primarily carried out in a scientific computing environment. As @thisted2 point out, "computational advances have changed the face of statistical practice by transforming what we do and by challenging how we think about scientific problems." To support and help facilitate the use of scientific computing, examples using the R computer language will be used throughout this work.  -->

<!-- The organization of content is consistent with the sequence this content is taught in EPsy 8252, the second of two applied statistics courses that form the foundational sequence for many graduate students in the educational and social sciences at the University of Minnesota. This course require that students have taken a previous statistics course at the graduate level focusing on the GLM.  -->

## Acknowledgments

Many thanks to all the students in our courses who have been through previous iterations of this material. Your feedback has been invaluable, and you are the world's greatest copyeditors. In particular, we would like to thank Regina Lisinker and Suzanne Loch who have both been instrumental contributors to the EPSY 1261 content over the years.
